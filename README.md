# Selective Inference on Jupyter Notebooks
A selective inference framework based on ["Inference after black box selection"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09973) (Markovic, Taylor, Taylor).

## Overview
In this repository, we define a script that can perform inference on a selective model defined in a Jupyter Notebook. We perform the inference algorithm by executing certain cells according to their metadata.

## Notebook Specifications
In order to run this selective inference algorithm, some constraints are necessary on layout of the given notebook.
