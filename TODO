----------
 * Within the preprocessors, save selection as a single consistent
   entry in `resources`, rather than having separate `fixed_selection`
   and `set_selection` entries.
    > Create a function argument or separate entry of `resources`
      specifying the selection type (depending on whether we choose to
      generate selection indicators in the notebook or in the inference
      script)

----------
 * Integrate selection indicators into preprocessing script [DONE]
 * Save initial selected_variables to notebook metadata [DONE]
    > Save serialized base 64 of feather [DONE]
 * Keep a running dataframe of sufficient stats + selection indicators
    > Either save initial selection indicators (all 1) + sufficient stat
      to this dataframe, or just save them to the notebook metadata
